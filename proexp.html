								<h3>Takeda Pharmaceutical</h3>
								<h4>Role : Digital Innovation â€“ Intern</h4>
									<p>
										During my tenure at Takeda Pharmaceutical, I led the creation of a report comparison tool that streamlined collaboration across multiple cross-functional teams, resulting in enhanced data accuracy and operational efficiency. I utilized Python to engineer automated processes that reduced data processing times by 50%, while leaving room for future scalability and potential integration with cloud environments. This innovation not only optimized current workflows but also set a precedent for broader application across manual tasks within the GRO division. My efforts were rooted in analyzing post-market pharmaceutical data, where I engaged with industry data standards, leveraging Snowflake to derive data-driven insights. This hands-on experience fostered a deep understanding of data compliance and the importance of standardization within the pharmaceutical sector.
